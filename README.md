I did this project as a part of The Odin Project, a great free website that is meant to aggregate all the resources necessary to go from zero knowledge to a web developer. Can be found here: https://www.theodinproject.com/

## Why this project

This project felt simple at the outset and became more complicated once I started trying to create it. It teaches you a fundamental aspect of coding at any larger scale: thinking ahead to understand how your code should behave in a number of unique situations.
